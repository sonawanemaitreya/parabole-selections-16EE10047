To create knowledge graphs, we shall be able to identify its components first- capture entities, attributes, and relationships, in which nodes are entities, labelled using attributes and edges between two nodes capture relationship between entities.

For knowledge extraction/graph construction we can use-

1. to identify entities- Named Entity Recognition
			Entity coreference
			Entity linking 
			Entity resolution
2. to identify attributes- Named Entity Recognition
				Collective classification
3. to relate(edges) - relation extarction
			semantic role labelling
			link prediction
